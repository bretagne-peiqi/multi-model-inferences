#Multi-Model Inference acceralation on multi-core processors
This project is used for SOTA Edge AI Inference on HuaWei Atlas 200 inference device.

#Context
Multi-model parallism inference on edge device has a huge demand in industry. especially in computer vision area.
However, resouce-constraint and lack of good schedule policy limited the development.

The idea of this project is to coordinate models and AICores in parallel with config options for priority.
